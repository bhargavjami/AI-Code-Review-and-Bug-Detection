# AI-Driven Automated Code Review and Bug Detection

An AI-based tool designed to automatically review code for quality, detect potential bugs, and suggest improvements in real-time. The project aims to assist developers by using machine learning models to provide intelligent feedback on submitted code.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Analyzes source code (Python) and provides suggestions for improvement
- Detects simple logical bugs, code style issues, and redundant statements
- Designed to mimic basic functionality of static analysis tools with AI enhancements

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow** – for model training and prediction
- **Flask** – to create a lightweight web interface
- **Scikit-learn** – for model building and experimentation
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – for parsing and interpreting code
- **NumPy & Pandas** – for data handling and preprocessing

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User submits Python code via a web interface
2. The backend processes the code using NLP and static analysis logic
3. A trained ML model classifies issues and highlights:
   - Common bug patterns
   - Code optimization suggestions
   - Code smells or redundant logic
4. Results are displayed with contextual explanations

## 💡 Key Features

- Real-time web-based code review
- Learns from labeled bug patterns and code smells
- Easily extendable to support multiple programming languages
- Minimal dependencies – deployable in small developer environments

---

## 📈 Possible Extensions

- Add support for Java, C++, and JavaScript
- Integrate GitHub webhook to auto-review pull requests
- Link to external linters (like pylint, flake8) for hybrid feedback
- Enhance with deep learning models (e.g., CodeBERT)
